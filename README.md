# Traversability prediction of the environment for mobile robots

This repository contains code for training and testing a neural network for predicting the traversability of the
environment for mobile robots. The networks are trained od RELLIS-3D and RUGD datasets. The code is based on
the [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) framework.
The benchmarking results are not yet published, but will be soon.

## Installation

First clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/aleskucera/OFFSEG.git
